# Particles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

```bash
npm start
```

## Using the app

- Press the `e` key and click to add an emitter.

- Press the `r` key to remove the most recently added particle emitter.

  - There is no way to undo a removal, so be careful!

- Press the `p` key to turn the emitters on or off.
  When the emitters are on, they emit particles.
  When they are off, they do not.

- If you press the space key, the particle animation will pause as soon as you release it.
  To resume the animation, hold down the space key, and the animation will continue running for as long as you hold down the key.
